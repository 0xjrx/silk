## Overview

A simple **PoC** for executing shellcode inside a **fiber**, without requiring APIs such as `CreateThread`.

## Background

I was reading through **Windows Internals Part 1** (great book btw) and stumbled upon so-called **'Fibers'**.

üîπ A **fiber** is an execution unit which is scheduled by the process itself as opposed to the OS scheduler  
üîπ They run within the thread which schedules them, but need **no call** to `CreateThread`  
üîπ My initial thought was *"Well this is interesting, maybe you can also run shellcode with this..."* without triggering common detection patterns and I was right

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is by no means new information and there are probably already some other PoCs out there but I thought I'd share mine.

## To Do
- [ ] Add **TartarusGate** dynamic syscalls and other evasion stuff
